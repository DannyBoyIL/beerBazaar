        <h2>About BEERBAZAAR</h2>
        <p class="big bgline">WE CREATED BEERBAZAAR TO SPREAD LOVE & BEER, THE ISRAELI WAY.  </p>
        <p>And we won't rest until everybody has a cold, delicious, Israeli craft beer in their hand.</p>
        <p>BeerBazaar started as a lone bar in Tel Aviv’s Carmel market in 2013. We’ve since grown to 4 TLV locations and one in Jerusalem’s Mahane Yehuda Market</p>
        <p>We love Israeli Craft Beer, so come in and we'll talk your ear off about it.</p>
        <p><strong>BeerBazaar Online</strong></p>
        <p>We launched this site to make our amazing selection of Israeli craft beer available for home deliveries.  Currently only delivering in Jerusalem & Tel Aviv, but we hope to expand to the rest of Israel very soon.  If you'd like to be notified when we deliver to you, just let us know where you are by clicking here.</p>        
        <p>Please let us know if you have any questions, comments, feedback, beer questions, or anything else on our contact page or Facebook.</p>
